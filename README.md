# SPI Bus Protocol with Built-In Self-Test (BIST)

This project implements the *Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Bus Protocol* along with an integrated *Built-In Self-Test (BIST)* module in Verilog. The design demonstrates reliable SPI communication between master and slave devices while incorporating self-test functionality to verify correct operation without requiring extensive external test equipment.

## Features

* SPI Master and Slave implementation
* Supports standard SPI communication (MOSI, MISO, SCLK, CS)
* Built-In Self-Test (BIST) for automatic functional verification
* Modular and synthesizable Verilog design
* Comprehensive testbench for simulation and validation
* Suitable for FPGA implementation and digital design learning

## Project Structure

* *SPI Master* – Generates clock, chip select, and controls data transmission.
* *SPI Slave* – Receives and transmits data according to SPI protocol.
* *BIST Module* – Automatically generates test patterns, applies them to the SPI interface, and checks the responses for correctness.
* *Testbench* – Verifies normal SPI operation as well as BIST functionality.

## Applications

* FPGA and ASIC design projects
* Digital communication systems
* Embedded systems
* Hardware verification and self-testing
* Educational projects for learning SPI protocol and Design-for-Test (DFT) concepts

## Tools Used

* Verilog HDL
* ModelSim / QuestaSim / Vivado Simulator (or any Verilog simulator)

## Future Enhancements

* Support for all four SPI modes (CPOL/CPHA)
* Configurable clock divider
* Error logging and diagnostic reporting
* Multiple slave support
* SystemVerilog/UVM-based verification environment

This repository is intended for students, FPGA developers, and VLSI engineers looking to understand SPI communication, hardware design, and Built-In Self-Test (BIST) implementation in a practical and modular way.
